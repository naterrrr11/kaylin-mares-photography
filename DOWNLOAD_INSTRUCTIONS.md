# 📥 How to Download Your Website

Your complete website is packaged and ready! Here's how to download it:

## 📦 Your Package Location
```

## 🎯 Download Methods

### Method 1: Direct Download Link (Easiest)
I'll create a simple download script for you. Just follow these steps:

1. I'll move the file to a publicly accessible location
2. You can download it directly from there

### Method 2: Through Emergent Interface
Look for one of these options in your Emergent interface:
- **File Browser** - Navigate to `/app/export_package/` and download the zip
- **Download Button** - Some interfaces have a download option
- **Export Function** - Check if there's an export/download feature

### Method 3: Copy Individual Files
If you can't download the zip, I can show you all the individual files and you can copy them manually.

## ✅ What to Do After Download

1. **Extract the zip file** on your computer
2. **Open the folder** and you'll see:
   ```
   kaylin_mares_photography_20260109_020530/
   ├── README.md
   ├── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
   ├── frontend/
   └── backend/
   ```
3. **Read COMPLETE_OWNERSHIP_GUIDE.md** for next steps
4. **Test locally** before deploying (optional)
5. **Deploy to internet** using the guides provided

## 🆘 Can't Download?

If none of these methods work, I can:
1. Create individual file downloads
2. Show you how to copy/paste the code
3. Help you set up a GitHub repository
4. Create smaller separate packages

Let me know which method works for you!
